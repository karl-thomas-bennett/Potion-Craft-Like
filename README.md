# Potion-Craft-Like
Like Potion Craft but more complicated and with worse graphics.
I wanted to try making somehthing like Potion Craft but with more versatile lines, so I made a tool for creating lines with meshes.
## Completed
* Line drawing tool
* Potions that instantiates and follows lines (technically the line and background objects move toward it)
## Todo
* Camera Panning
* Fog of war
* Making a potion
* Traps
* Integration with another game (You make potions and then use them)
